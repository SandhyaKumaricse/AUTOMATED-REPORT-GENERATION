##üìå Task 2 - Automated Report Generation

## üìÑ Description

This task required the development of a script to read data from a **CSV file**, perform basic **statistical analysis**, and generate a **formatted PDF report** using Python. The objective was to automate the reporting process without relying on manual formatting or external applications.

I used a sample dataset representing student scores. The script calculates average, highest, and lowest scores and presents them in a clean, tabular PDF format. The focus was on simplicity and readability, ensuring the solution met the internship requirements without adding any features beyond the given instructions.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.12
* **Libraries Used:**

  * `csv` ‚Äì for reading structured CSV data
  * `fpdf` ‚Äì to create and style PDF documents
* **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* **Environment:** Windows 10 / Terminal

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Summary

1. Read the dataset from `data.csv`, which contains student names and their scores.
2. Parsed the data and calculated:

   * Average Score
   * Highest Score
   * Lowest Score
3. Used the `fpdf` library to generate a structured PDF with:

   * A title
   * A table listing each student's name and score
   * A summary section with the calculated metrics

The output is saved as `report.pdf`, containing a clear breakdown of the data in a print-ready format.

## üåç Real-World Applications

* **Academic Institutions:** Automatically generate student performance reports.
* **HR & Teams:** Summarize employee assessments or feedback forms.
* **Survey Analysis:** Create printable summaries from form submissions.
* **Business Dashboards:** Export regular business metrics in a document-friendly format.

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

* A Python script: `task_2.py`
* Sample input file: `data.csv`
* Output PDF report: `report.pdf`

This task provided practical exposure to file handling and report automation using Python, a highly valuable skill in administrative, data analysis, and reporting roles.
